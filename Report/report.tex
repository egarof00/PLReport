\section{Introduction}\label{intro}
Welcome to my class report! As the class progresses, I will add my learning
from each week. For now, it only has week one. 
\section{Week by Week}\label{homework}

\subsection{Week 1}
\subsubsection*{Notes}
This week we discussed the foundation of what the class is about.
The main idea was that this class is largely about the intersection
of math and programming, beginning with revisiting the principles we learned
in discrete mathematics. We also learned about LaTeX, which we will be using throughout 
the semester to edit documents like this one. The general idea of the week was setting all of us 
students up for what to expect throughout the semester.
\subsubsection*{Homework}

The reading that we had to cover for homework discussed the MUI problem, which helps us
break down what a formal system is, and how these attributes can be seen in mathematics like 
discrete math.

We also had to complete the tutorial world of the natural number game. 
Here are the solutions for levels 5-8.

\subsubsection*{Level 5}
Goal: a+(b+0)+(c+0)=a+b+c

Solution:
\begin{lstlisting}
rw[add_zero]
rfl
\end{lstlisting}
\subsubsection*{Level 6}
Goal: a+(b+0)+(c+0)=a+b+c

Solution:
\begin{lstlisting}
rw[add_zero c]
rw[add_zero]
rfl
\end{lstlisting}
\subsubsection*{Level 7}
Goal: succ n = n + 1

Solution:
\begin{lstlisting}
rw[one_eq_succ_zero]
rw[add_succ]
rw[add_zero]
rfl
\end{lstlisting}
\subsubsection*{Level 8}
Goal: 2 + 2 = 4

Solution:
\begin{lstlisting}
nth_rewrite 2[two_eq_succ_one]
rw[one_eq_succ_zero]
rw[four_eq_succ_three]
rw[three_eq_succ_two]
nth_rewrite 2[two_eq_succ_one]
rw[one_eq_succ_zero]
rw[two_eq_succ_one]
rw[one_eq_succ_zero]
rw[add_succ]
rw[add_succ]
rw[add_zero]
rfl
\end{lstlisting}

I learned a lot from this homework. It basically acted as a refresher for discrete mathematics, and 
how what seems like such a simple solution is much more complicated than you think it is. It also shows 
the various ways that you can derive the same solutions.


%In case you want to draw automata in Latex, you can use the tikz %package. Here is an example of a simple automaton:
%
%\begin{tikzpicture}[shorten >=1pt,node distance=2cm,on grid,auto] 
%  \node[state] (q_1)   {$q_1$}; 
%  \node[state] (q_2) [above right=of q_1] {$q_2$}; 
%  \node[state] (q_3) [below right=of q_2] {$q_3$}; 
%   \path[->] 
%   (q_1) edge  node {0} (q_2)
%         edge  node [swap] {1} (q_3)
%   (q_2) edge  node  {1} (q_3)
%         edge [loop above] node {0} ()
%   (q_3) edge [loop below] node {0,1} ();
%\end{tikzpicture}
%
%By the way, GPT-4 is quite good at outputting tikz code.

\subsubsection*{Comments and Questions}

This week provided me with a good refresher of the discrete mathematics class that I took a while ago. It brought to my attention how much
there is a crossover between math and code, and I am so excited to explore that in this class.

I always wonder who decided to start defining these mathematical relations? They have evolved so far and it is amazing to see the foundation that exists in discrete and how complicated it really is to have built up that foundation to all of the mathematical relations that we analyze now. I wonder if math will continue to get more and more complicated from the foundation that is laid by discrete.

% \section{Lessons from the Assignments}

% (Delete and Replace): Write three pages about your individual contributions to the project.

% On 3 pages you describe lessons you learned from the project. Be as technical and detailed as possible. Particularly valuable are \emph{interesting} examples where you connect concrete technical details with \emph{interesting} general observations or where the theory discussed in the lectures helped with the design or implementation of the project.

% Write this section during the semester. This is approximately a quarter of apage per week and the material should come from the work you do anyway. Just keep your eyes open for interesting lessons.

% Make sure that you use \LaTeX{} to structure your writing (eg by using subsections).

% \section{Conclusion}\label{conclusion}

% (Delete and Replace): (approx 400 words) A critical reflection on the content of the course. Step back from the technical details. How does the course fit into the wider world of software engineering? What did you find most interesting or useful? What improvements would you suggest?
